## 🎮 **About Bird Sort 2**

Bird Sort 2 is a captivating puzzle game where players sort colored birds perched on tree branches, aiming to group birds of the same color together. Once grouped, these birds can fly away, freeing up branch space for further sorting. The game introduces challenges such as limited branch space and specific sorting rules, making it both engaging and mentally stimulating.
